### Python Markov Chain Monte-Carlo Implementation
***

1. Overview

  This project contains implementation of MCMC using python.
  The codes are tested on python 3.3 and some of them needs "matplotlib" to run.
  Currently, the project contains following algorithms.
  - Metropolis Hastings method (1D and 2D)
  - MCMC with simulated annealing (1D only)
  - Gibbs sampling (2D only)
  - Slice sampling (1D only)
  - Hybrid Monte-Carlo (1D and 2D)
